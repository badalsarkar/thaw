# Thaw

*Thaw* is an hierarchical organizable and perfectly versionable document framework with an export to PDF.

## Motivation

Current modern alternatives to TeX/LaTeX and its derivatives include WYSIWYG editors like DTP software which is usually very expensive (Adobe InDesign) or human-readable formats like Markdown that lack a lot of features.
We want to improve the situation by proposing *Thaw* which lets you organize your documents in a human-readable way while being easy to learn and use as well as being suitable for version control software like Git.
